    <h2>Fast and easy no bake energy balls</h2>
    <p>Coconut date balls are little balls of nutrition made with dates and nuts and then coated in shredded coconut – an easy-to-make sweet & healthy vegan snack!
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>10-12 medjool dates
        <li>2 cups pecans
        <li>Pinch sea salt
        <li>¼ cup desiccated coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pit the medjool dates and soak them in warm water for 10 minutes until they soften
        <li>Place the pitted dates and pecans in the bowl of a large food processor. Blend on high until a thick “dough” is formed and the mixture feels sticky.
        <li>Scoop about 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture and use your hands to roll it into a ball. If you have time you can let them set in the fridge for 5 minutes.
        <li>Roll the energy bites into desiccated or shredded coconut pressing gently so they adhere. Makes about 12-14 bites.
