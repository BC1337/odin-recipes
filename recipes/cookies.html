    <h2>Soft No Bake Cookies</h2>
    <p>A super fast, super easy to make cookie made with chewy oatmeal, rich cocoa and creamy peanut butter. They're perfectly fudgy and always just too good to resist! A childhood favorite that I'm still making all the time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) salted butter</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (32g) unsweetened cocoa powder
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160g) creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>3 cups (275g) quick oats (don't use old fashioned oats)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or set out approximately 29 cupcake liners.
        <li>In a 2.5 to 3 quart medium saucepan combine butter, sugar, cocoa, and milk.
        <li>Set over medium heat, and cook stirring frequently until it reaches a full boil. 
        <li>Allow mixture to boil 60 seconds without stirring. 
        <li>Remove from heat, immediately add in vanilla, peanut butter and quick oats. 
        <li>Stir mixture until well combined then, using a medium (2 Tbsp) cookie scoop or two spoons drop mixture onto lined baking sheets or into cupcake liners. 
        <li>Allow to rest at room temperature until set, about 20 - 30 minutes (to speed up setting refrigerate).
        <li>Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.
    </ol>
